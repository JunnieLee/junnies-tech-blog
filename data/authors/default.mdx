# Strengths and Characteristics

I am full of curiosity and the desire to explore. Therefore, I have sought opportunities for a variety of experiences, through which I am realizing my core value of "continuous growth orientation."

Also, I have interests and experience in various fields. Up to now, I have had diverse experiences encompassing art, music, philosophy, market and marketing, and engineering. With knowledge across different domains, I can avoid being confined to a single sector and can inject vitality into the direction of the team by ingeniously weaving together disparate concepts to present novel ideas.

Last but not least, I have a bright and hopeful personality. I am naturally positive, with good resilience in crisis and failure situations, which allows me to quickly find ways to progress to the next stage.

# Career Vision

I feel the greatest self-efficacy in capturing the needs and desires of the public that are not explicitly visible and even unknown to themselves, and in providing that to them. The message of Steve Jobs, "People don't know what they want until you show it to them," is the premise of the direction I am pursuing.

The stage of discovering the needs/wants and latent demands of the public, 2. The stage of actually implementing solutions to satisfy those needs and solve problems. In both stages, the skillful use of computational methods is the most crucial competency, and I believe the outcome depends greatly on the level of this ability.
Under this direction, firmly centered in the broad academic roots of computer science, and moving forward, through my domain knowledge in 'consumer studies,' I will continuously ponder and develop user-centered programs and services that are not just technically sophisticated but actually enrich the lives of various users.
